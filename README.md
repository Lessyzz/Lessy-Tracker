This project is using Riot Games Api (https://developer.riotgames.com/).
Receiving live game data with Api and processing them.

Currently received data:

Enemy and ally team; Nicknames, Champions, Spells.

This program gets the api key from the https://lessy.pythonanywhere.com/apikey site. I made this system because api key is reloading everyday.
